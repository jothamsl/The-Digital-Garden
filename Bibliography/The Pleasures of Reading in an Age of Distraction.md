- **Alan Jacobs** the author of *The Pleasure of Reading in an Age of Distraction*, argues that reading is alive and well, but we suffer from confidence issues: we wonder whether we read well, with proper [[How to Remember What You Read#^843d43|focus and attentiveness]], and with genuine discernment.

> *So this is what I say to my petitioners: For heaven’s sake, don’t turn reading into the intellectual equivalent of eating organic greens, or (shifting the metaphor slightly) some fearfully disciplined appointment with an elliptical trainer of the mind in which you count words or pages the way some people fix their attention on the “calories burned” readout—some assiduous and taxing exercise that allows you to look back on your conquest of [Middlemarch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143123815/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0143123815) with grim satisfaction. How depressing. This kind of thing is not reading at all, but what C. S. Lewis once called “cosmical and ethical hygiene.”*

### Great Books

On Great books, Jacobs writes:
> *Read what gives you delight—at least most of the time—and do so without shame. And even if you are that rare sort of person who is delighted chiefly by what some people call Great Books, don’t make them your steady intellectual diet, any more than you would eat at the most elegant of restaurants every day. It would be too much. Great books are great in part because of what they ask of their readers: they are not readily encountered, easily assessed.*

### The Pleasure of Books
What should you do if you’re reading a book that fails to delight you?

> For if this particular book is not giving me pleasure now, it may give me pleasure later, if I allow it to do so. Maybe it’s just starting slowly but will pick up speed; maybe I haven’t fully grasped the idiom it’s working in but eventually will figure it out; maybe the problem is not with the book but with my own powers of concentration because I slept fitfully last night. …

> Many maybes. But in any case, I have to decide whether to persevere, and for a long time my default position was to continue. Indeed, I was twenty years old before I failed to finish a book I had started: it was The Recognitions, a novel by William Gaddis, and I gave up, after an extended period of moral paralysis, at page 666. That day I grieved, feeling that I had been forced from some noble pedestal; but I work up the next morning with my soul singing. After all, though I would never get back the hours I had devoted to those 666 pages, the hours I would have spent ploughing through the remaining four hundred were mine to spend as I could. I had been granted time as a pure and sweet gift.

The quote above argues that if a book doesn’t spark your interest or give you pleasure now, it may give interest you later if you give it a chance. It may start off slow and boring, but will eventually pick up speed.

### Reading Guides
On How to Read a book and similar guides, Jacob writes:

> *And one of the primary reasons I am so suspicious of How to Read a Book and similar guides is that they promise to help us offload accountability for our reading: they say, implicitly, that self-knowledge and discernment aren’t needful because experts can take care of that for us.*
