## Word Assessment: How to count your words (450 words)
- If attempting questions on letter writing, words in that place are not counted.
- In any essay the words in the first line are not counted. This is because it starts the paragraph. 

If you have (left side) words per line, you should have (right side) lines.

## Summary Writing

Summaries can be written using two methods:
- The Preamble method
- The simple sentence approach.

Using the preamble method is discouraged. Why? If it is wrongly used, half of the mark allotted to the correct answer is removed.

e.g 
In three sentences **one for each** state the reasons why Dr. Ameachi came late today.

### Using Preamble method
The reasons why Dr Ameachi came late this morning are:
1. He **had** a flat tire.
2. He was drenched.
3. He met the gate locked.

Using the word **had** yields a reduction in mark by $2\frac{1}{2}$ 

### Using Simple sentences
