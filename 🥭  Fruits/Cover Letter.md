Hey there!,

I am writing to express my interest as a freelancer to this job. I am excited about the opportunity to work with you, and I believe that my experience will be a great fit for this role.

As an experienced Transcriptor, I have developed several skills that would be helpful for this job. These include:

-A strong understanding of the English language.

-A typing speed of about 105 WPM.

-The ability to maintain the context and underlying information of the text.

-The ability to identify and correct errors of a given text.

-Experience with several text editors such as Microsoft word and Google Docs.

I believe these are important skills for this role because they help me perform well under pressure, when time is short, or when there is a lot of ambiguity as to how best to accomplish tasks.
