## Chpt 1 
- If you are unaware of all possible actions you could take, you may be unable to solve the problem.
- List the constraints of the problem in order to define the possible actions that can be taken. 
- Restating the problem in a more formal manner is a great technique for gaining insight into a problem.
- Generalize the actions that can be taken rather than specifically list them.
- Thinking about the problem may be as productive, or in some cases more than thinking about the solution.
- It’s better to develop a strategy than to attack the problem through trial and error. 
- Learn to recognize analogies.
### General Problem-Solving Techniques
#### Always Have a Plan
- Plans don’t always work, they have to be tried then fail before they are refined and given another chance.
- Without planning, you only have one goal: solve the whole problem.
- Planning allows you to set intermediate goals and achieve them.
#### Restate the Problem
