[Feynman: Magnets (and Why?)](https://youtu.be/Q1lL-hXO27Q)

- When asking why, you have to believe that there is something true otherwise you keep perpetually asking why.
-  The level at which you stop asking why, plays a huge role in how you understand things. Imagine a scenario, you go ice skating with your friends, one of them slips and you ask why? they answer, saying “because the ice is slippery”. You could stop and accept this answer, or you press on and keep asking why, “why is the ice slippery?”; Your friend is unable to find an answer to that question and simply refuses to overthink it. If you find someone that is able to answer the question, you don’t only put yourself in a position to find the solution, but you build an understanding of the concept as a whole.
-  Feynman explains the problem of using analogies over first principles thinking. He gives an example: 
> *For example, if we said the magnets attract like rubber bands, I would be cheating you. Because they’re not connected by rubber bands. I’d soon be in trouble. And secondly, if you were curious enough, you’d ask me why rubber bands tend to pull back together again, and I would end up explaining that in terms of electrical forces, which are the very things that I’m trying to use the rubber bands to explain. So I have cheated very badly, you see. So I am not going to be able to give you an answer to why magnets attract each other except to tell you that they do. And to tell you that that’s one of the elements in the world – there are electrical forces, magnetic forces, gravitational forces, and others, and those are some of the parts. If you were a student, I could go further. I could tell you that the magnetic forces are related to the electrical forces very intimately, that the relationship between the gravity forces and electrical forces remains unknown, and so on. But I really can’t do a good job, any job, of explaining magnetic force in terms of something else you’re more familiar with, because I don’t understand it in terms of anything else that you’re more familiar with.*
