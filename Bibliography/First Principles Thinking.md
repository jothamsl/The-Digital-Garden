-  It is one of the best ways to reverse-engineer complicated problems and unleash creative possibility.
-  A **First principle** is a foundational proposition or assumption that stands alone. ^898b11
-  The idea is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up.
-  *Aristotle* defined first principles as **“the first basis from which a thing is known.”**
-  The difference between reasoning by first principles and reasoning by analogy is like the difference between being a chef and being a cook. If the cook lost the recipe, he’d be screwed. The chef, on the other hand, understands the flavor profiles and combinations at such a fundamental level that he doesn’t even use a recipe. He has real knowledge as opposed to know-how.

### Techniques for Establishing First Principles
-  **Socratic Questioning**: disciplined questioning process used to establish truths, reveal underlying assumptions and separate knowledge from ignorance. ^2d5610
	-  **Clarifying your thinking** & **explaining the origins of your ideas** 
	-  **Challenging assumptions**
	-  **Looking for evidence**
	-  **Examining consequences and implications**
	-  **Questioning the original questions**

> *“I think people’s thinking process is too bound by convention or analogy to prior experiences. It’s rare that people try to think of something on a first principles basis. They’ll say, “We’ll do that because it’s always been done that way.” Or they’ll not do it because “Well, nobody’s ever done that, so it must not be good. But that’s just a ridiculous way to think. You have to build up the reasoning from the ground up—“from the first principles” is the phrase that’s used in physics. You look at the fundamentals and construct your reasoning from that, and then you see if you have a conclusion that works or doesn’t work, and it may or may not be different from what people have done in the past.”*

-  **Elon Musk** employed this method in *SpaceX*.
-  **Johan Peretti** (founder of *Buzzfeed*) used first principle thinking to promote Buzzfeed to the top.

### Employing First Principles in Your Daily Life.
-  The real power of first-principles thinking is moving away from incremental improvement and into possibility.
-  Analogies are beneficial but come with the cost of limiting our beliefs about what’s possible and allow people to argue without ever exposing our (faulty) thinking.

##### Common Limiting Beliefs That We Tell Ourselves
-  “I don’t have a good memory”
-  “There is too much information out there”
-  “All the good ideas are taken”
-  “We need to move first”
-  “I can’t do that; it’s never been done before”
