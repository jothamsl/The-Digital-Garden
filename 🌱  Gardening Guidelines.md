# ðŸŒ± Gardening Guidelines

These are the guidelines which guide the process of knowledge accumulation and creation in this garden.

> Associative ontologies should be used in place of hierarchical taxonomies 
> *Andy's Working Notes*

There are **Five** groups:
1. **ðŸŒ° Seeds:** These are notes which exist solely for the purpose of **taking down immediate ideas or thoughts**, along with concepts from biobliographical sources.
2. **ðŸŽ‹ Branches:** These are much refined versions of seeds which are **atomic and interconnected**. They only express a single idea and **cannot reference external sources** (can only be done through seeds). 
3. **ðŸ¥­ Fruits:** These **self-produced articles, essays and research notes**  when working on a topic. It consists of structured arguments and sections which encompass it's context. Fruits are only allowed to reference **Branches and external sources**.
4. **Bibliography:** This is less of a group of notes and more of a folder. It contains pdf, markdown and other text files from third-party sources. They are meant for directly referencing bibliographic sources. **DO NOT MODIFY**
5. **Temp:** This folder exists to store the different templates for varying note types
6. **Media:** This folder holds image and video content which is used across several notes.
