When current flows through a circuit, small Magnetic fields are formed.

Charged particles radially emit an electric field around them.

A changing electric field, produces aMagnetic field and a **changing magnetic field** produces an **electric field**.

The repetition of this process produces an electromagnetic wave which propagates through space. **Electromagnetic waves don’t need a medium to travel**. They don’t need particles around them to move from one place to another.

In the image above, The magnetic field can be seen to be perpendicular to the electric field.

The region of frequencies and wavelengths a EM wave can have is known as the electromagnetic spectrum

The higher the frequency, the lower the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave.The greater the frequency of an EM wave, the **more energetic and dangerous** it becomes.

#### How Do we Produce a Changing Electric Field?
This is done by moving the charged particle around.

#### How Do we Produce a Changing Magnetic Field?
We can do this by periodically changing the direction of the flow of current.

#### The Properties of Electromagnetic Waves
The properties of electromagnetic waves can be found [[Electromagnetic Radiation#^e6c21d|here]].
