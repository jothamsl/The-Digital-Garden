## Seeds

- A **seed** is a structure which develops from the ovule after the fertilisation of a plant. 
- The future root system of an embryo seed is known as the **radicle** 
- The future shoot system of an embryo seed is known as the **plumule**
- Plant seeds with two seed leaves are called **dicotyledonous plants**
- Plant seeds with one seed leaf are called **monocotyledonous plants**
- The endosperm nucleus develops into an endosperm which **stores food** for the the developing embryo.
- The **micropyle** is a tiny hole which absorbs water and diffuses air during germination.
- Seeds which use up the endosperm are called are called **non-endospermic seeds.**
	- examples are **cowpea, groundnut, Okra, pride of barbados**
- Seeds that donâ€™t completely use up the food in the endosperm are called **endospermic seeds**.
	- Examples are **coconut, palmnut,  maize,  rice, guinea corn**. 
- Food in the endosperm is stored as **proteins, fats or carbohydrates**. 

## Fruits 
- A **Fruit** is the structure which develops from the ovary after fertilization of a plant. It is also known as a mature ovary containing one or more seeds. 
- During the development of a fruit, the fruit develops into a **pericarp or fruit coat**. 
- At maturity, the pericarp is either **hard & dry** or **soft & fleshy**.  
- Fruits and seeds are identified according to **the amount of scars they have**.
- Fruits have **two scars** which are:
	- The remains of the style at one end.
	- The remains of the receptacle at the opposite end.
- Seeds have only **one scar/hilum** representing **the point of attachment of the seed to the placenta of the ovary.**

### Classification of Fruits based on the nature of the ovary
- **Simple Fruits**: These are fruit which are formed from a single flower in which **the gynoecium is made up of either a single carpel or many united carpels.** Majority of fruits belong to this group (synacarpous ovary). 
- **Aggregate Fruits**: These are fruits which are are formed from a single flower in which **the gynoecium consists of many free carpels**. (apocarpous ovary).
- **Multiple Fruits**: These are fruits formed from **many flowers** whose **ovaries unite together, with other parts of the flower after fertilization**.  

- A **true fruit** is a fruit formed from the ovary of a flower alone.
- A **false fruit** is a fruit formed from the ovary as well as any other part of the flower or infloresence.  
	- examples are **inflorescence stalk of pineapple**, **the pedicel and receptacle of cashew nut** and the **calyx of tridax and emilia**. These parts ripen along with their ovaries.  

### Classification of fruits according to the nature of the fruit-walls at maturity and manner in which the seeds are released from the fruits.
- **Dry Indehiscent fruits:** These are **one-seeded fruits** whose **walls become hard and dry at maturity**, but the **fruit walls or pericarps do not split on their own to liberate the seeds**. Types 
	- **Achenes**
	- **Nut**
	- **Cypsela**
	- **Caryopsis**
	- **Samara**
- **Dry Dehiscent fruits:** These are **one or many seeded fruits** whose **walls are hard and dry at maturity** and **have definite lines through which they split to liberate the seeds.**
	- **Legumes**: simple dry dehiscent fruits splitting by two longitudinal lines into two halves at maturity. e.g pride of barbados, oil bean tree, delonix, cowpea.
	- **Follicles**
	- **Capsules**
	- **Schizocarp**
- **Succulent fruits:** These are fruits whose **walls become soft and fleshy at maturity**. **They are indehiscent**. 

### Types of Succulent fruits
- **Drupes**: This is a **one-seeded succulent fruit** in which the **pericarp consists of three layers**. These layers are the:
	- **outer layer/epicarp**
	- **Middle layer/mesocarp**
	- **innder layer/endocarp**
	- Only the **epicarp & mesocarp** are fleshy. The endocarp which encloses the seeds is **hard and woody**. 
- **Berry**: This is a many seeded succulent fruit that consists of an **epicarp**, **mesocarp** and **endocarp**. But unlike the drupes, the **endocarp is edible**. e.g tomato, guava, garden egg and banana seeds.
- **Pepo:** This is a simple true fruit with the epicarp and mesocarp fused together to form the rind (or skin).
- **Pome**:
