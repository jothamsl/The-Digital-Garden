#### What is it?
-  It is an [[202112301039 - Electromagnetic Radiation|electric and magnetic disturbance]] travelling through space at the [[202112301708 - Speed of Light|speed of light]]. 

#### What are it’s properties?

-  It contains neither mass nor charge but travels in packets or radiant energy called [[photons, or quanta]]. 
	-  e.g Light, X-rays, Gamma rays, Ultraviolet rays, Infrared rays.
-  Electromagnetic waves exhibit a [[202112301718 - Wave-Particle Duality|dual wave and particle nature]].
-  EM radiation travels in a waveform at a constant speed.
-  The velocity of the EM radiation $C$, is given as… $$C=\lambda\cdot v$$ ^dffa84
	- Where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $v$ is the frequency of the radiation. We know that all electromagnetic waves possess the same speed ([[202112301708 - Speed of Light|speed of light]]). so we can say that $C=2.998\cdot 10^8$ → $2.998\cdot 10^8=\lambda\cdot v$.
	- Because the velocity is constant, any increase in frequency results in a subsequent decrease in wavelength. Therefore wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional. 
-  All forms of EM radiation are grouped according to their wavelengths into an [[202112301750 - The Electromagnetic Spectrum|Electromagnetic Spectrum]]. ^bfc69a
-  The particle-like nature of EM radiation manifests in the interaction of [[ionizing]] [[photons]] with matter. 
-  The amount of energy (E) found in a photon is equal to its frequency ($v$) times Planck’s constant (h). $$E=vh$$
-  The energy of a photon is proportional to the frequency of the photon
