*A newly revived philosophy for publishing personal knowledge on the web.*

-  A **Garden** is a collection of evolving ideas that aren’t strictly organized by their publication date.
	-  **They’re inherently exploratory** - notes are linked through contextual associations
	-  **They aren’t refined or complete** - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.
	-  **They’re less rigid, less performative and less perfect** than the personal websites we are used to seeing.
