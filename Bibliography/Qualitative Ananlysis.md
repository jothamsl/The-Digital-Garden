> **Qualitative Analysis** is done to identify the elements and compounds that are present in a sample of a given substance.

> **Quantitative Analysis** is done to calculate the amount of an element or compound present in a given sample.

During titration, a solution is added to another solution of known volume until the chemical reaction between the two is complete. The change in colour signifies the completion of the reaction.

In any titration, a *standard solution* (one whoâ€™s concentration is known) must be used to react with a solution of unknown concentration.

> The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute in $1\ dm^3$ or $1000\ cm^3$ the solution. It can be expressed as $mol\ dm^{-3} or $g\ dm^{-3}$

**NOTE:** There is no suitable indicator for the titration of a weak acid and weak base, but any indicator can be used for a strong acid and base.

Volumetric analysis usually includes the titration of:
- **An acid against a base or trioxocarbonate(IV)** (Salts from trioxocarbonate (IV) acids when it reacts with metals and metallic oxides).
- **Oxidising agent against reducing agent**
- **One substance against another substance, giving a precipitate.**

> The concentration of a solution in $mol\ dm^{-3}$ is the molar concentration.

The following formulas can be used in concentration calculations:

$$\displaylines{Amount\ of\ substance=\frac{Number\ of\ particles}{6.02\times10^{23}}=\frac{N}{L}=mol^{-1}}$$
$$Amount\ of\ substance=\frac{Mass\ of\ substance}{Molar\ Mass}=\frac{N}{M}=mol^{-1}$$
$$Amount\ of\ substance= \frac{Mass\ of\ substance}{Mass\ of\ 1\ mole\ of\ substance}=\frac{m}{M}=g\ mol^{-1}$$

## Molar Solution
> A **Molar Solution** is an aqueous solution that contains 1 mole of a compound dissolved in $1 dm^{3}$ of a solution.

Molar concentration $C$ = $mol\ dm^{-3}$
Mass Concentration ($g\ dm^{-3}$) = $mol\ dm^{-3} \times molar\ mass$ = $molarity(M) \times molar\ mass$  

$$Mass\ Concentration\ (C)=molar\ concentration(m)\times molar\ mass(mm)$$
$$Molar\ Concentration = Molarity$$
$$Molar\ Concenctration=\frac{mass}{molar\ mass}\times\frac{1000}{vol}$$
## Volumetric Solution
> **Volumetric Analysis** is used to standardise unknown solutions, determine the purity of substances and calculate molar mass, molar concentration, mass concentration. 

The calculations involved are:
- **Balanced equation of the reaction**
- **Volumes of solutions used**
- **Concentration of the standard solution.**

The numerical coefficients of a balanced equation represents the number of moles of reactants and products.

$$\frac{Amount\ of\ A}{Amount\ of\ B}=\frac{a}{b}=mole\ ratio$$
$$Concentration=\frac{Amount}{Volume}=\frac{n}{v}$$
$$\frac{C_AV_A}{C_BV_B}=\frac{n_a}{n_b}=mole\ ratio$$
