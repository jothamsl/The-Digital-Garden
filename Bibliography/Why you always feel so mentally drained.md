In psychology, **decision fatigue** is a phenomenon where the mind becomes fatigued after a sustained period of decision making. This leads to individuals making bad decisions as time goes.

*  Companies have specifically designed certain things around you to leverage on your decision making
*  The contemporary human being makes about 3500 decisions per day.
	* The more decision you make in a day the more bad decisions are made.
-  Self-control is like a battery, every decision drains the charge of the battery. This low charge leaves us with little to no amount of energy left to make proper decisions later on.

Strategies to avoid **decision fatigue**:
*  Reduce the amount of decisions you have to make (Learn to say no).
*  Automate as many decisions as possible.
*  Make your most important decisions first thing in the morning.
*  Cut yourself some slack.
