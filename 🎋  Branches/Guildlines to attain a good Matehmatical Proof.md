The following are the guidelines to follow when writing a proof:

- **State your game plan:** Good proofs always highlights or describes the way of thinking in order to work around a given problem. For example, "we use case analysis" or "We argue by contradiction." . This stage is important because it informs the reader on how to think in a certain way which fosters understanding and clarity in the given proof.
- **Keep a linear flow:** Always try to keep your proofs linear and fixated on the problem to be proved. Any form of independent reasoning should be presented in such a way that it's able present it's contribution to the proposition that's yet to be proved.
- **A proof is an essay, not a calculation:** Proofs are long sequences of expressions which are mostly written in words. Use complete sentences to describe your ideas and methodologies.
- **Avoid excessive symbolism:** Don't saturate your work with tons of symbols. This leads to a large amount of ambiguity which confuses the reader.
- **Revise and Simplify:** Once your'e done proving a proposition, revise over your methodology and simplify your approach.
- **Introduce notation thoughtfully:** In most cases, defining a new symbol or notation would be necessary to explain an approach. Do this sparingly and only when needed.
- **Structure long proofs:** Make use of *preliminary lemmas* to assist in proving much larger proofs. If you're repeating the same arugment over and over, try to capture that arguement in a *general lemma*, which you can cite repeatedly instead.
- **Be wary of the "obvious":** When obvious facts reveal themselves, it's OK to label them as such and not to prove them.
- **Finish":** At some point in a proof, you’ll have established all the essential facts you need. Resist the temptation to quit and leave the reader to draw the “obvious” conclusion. Instead, tie everything together yourself and explain why the original claim follows.
