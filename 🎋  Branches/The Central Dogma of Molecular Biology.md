- The *central dogma of molecular biology* is an explaination of how genetic information flows in a biological system. 
- It's often stated as "DNA makes RNA which makes protein" (first stated by [Francis Crick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick) in 1957)
 
The central dogma formally states that **once "information" has passed into protein, it cannot get out again**.
- In more details, this means that the transfer of information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid,  or from nucleic acid to proteins may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or from protein to nucleic acid is impossible. 
- **Note:** Information in this context means the precise order/sequence of the bases or amino acids in the nucleic acids or proteins respectively.
