Understanding your [[circle of competence]] helps you avoid problems, identify opportunities for improvement, and learn from others.

> *What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.*
> **Warren Buffett**, *1996 Shareholder Letter*

Warren Buffet explains that the size of your knowledge is not as important as knowing the limits of your competence.

> *I’m no genius. I’m smart in spots - but I stay around those spots.*

The Circle of competence is a visual representation of how much we know about anything. It could be Economics, Being a lawyer, Running a company etc.

> “I couldn’t have given her $200 million worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock when I bought the business because she doesn’t understand stock. She understands cash. She understands furniture. She understands real estate. She doesn’t understand stocks, so she doesn’t have anything to do with them. If you deal with Mrs. B in what I would call her circle of competence… She is going to buy 5,000 end tables this afternoon (if the price is right). She is going to buy 20 different carpets in odd lots, and everything else like that [snaps fingers] because she understands carpet. She wouldn’t buy 100 shares of General Motors if it was at 50 cents a share.”

It doesn’t hurt to have such a narrow area of competence. In fact, one could argue the opposite and say Mrs. B’s rigid devotion to that area allowed her to focus.

So, the simple takeaway here is clear. If you want to improve your odds of success in life and business, then define the perimeter of your circle of competence, and operate inside. Over time, work to expand that circle but never fool your self about where it stands today, and never be afraid to say “I don’t know”.
