- **Refraction** is the bending of a light ray as it passes from two media of different densities.
- as light travels from a **less dense medium to a more dense medium,** the refracted ray bends towards the normal, hence **the angle of refraction is less than the angle of reflection**. The alternative also stands true.
- **LAWS OF REFRACTION:** 
	- The incident ray, the normal and refracted ray both lie on the same plane 
	- The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is constant for a given media. **This is known as snell’s law**
- **SNELL’S LAW**: Where $n$  is known as the **refractive index** of the second medium relative to the first medium. $$\frac{\sin i}{\sin r}=n$$
- using the *principle of reversibility of light*, we can say that the refractive index as light passing through medium $a$ to medium $b$ is the same as the inverse of the refractive index as light pass through medium $b$ to $a$. $$_an_b=\frac{1}{_bn_a}$$
- The refractive index is also given as: $$_an_b=\frac{speed\ of\ light\ in\ air\ (vacuum)}{speed\ of\ light\ in\ glass}$$
- **Apparent Depth** is a false perception of the depth of a medium, brought about by the refraction of light. 
- **Real Depth** is the actual depth of a medium.
- Real depth and apparent depth are related through the following formula (*refractive index*): $$n=\frac{Real\ Depth}{Apparent\ Depth}$$
- **Critical angle** is the angle of incidence in a denser medium when the angle of refraction is equal to $90^\circ$ 
- When the angle of reflection slightly exceeds the the critical angle, the **refracted ray disappears** and a **strong reflected ray** is formed. 
- **Total Internal Reflection** This is a phenomenon that occurs when the *angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle*, hence the *refracted rays are replaced by a strong reflected ray*. 
	- **Conditions for Total internal reflection**
		- Light must travel from an optically more dense to an optically less dense medium.
		- The angle of incidence in the denser medium must be greater than the critical angle.
	- Refractive index is **alsoooo** given as: $$n=\frac{1}{\sin C}$$
