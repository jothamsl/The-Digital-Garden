> **Organic evolution** is the series of gradual and adaptive changes living organisms have developed in response to the change in their environment.

- **Jean Baptist Lamarck** was a french biologist that put forward the **theory of organic evolution** in **1801**. His idea of organic evolution was built upon three ideas:
	- **The theory of need:** This theory highlights how organisms overtime develop physical features or more specifically, organs which materialise when the need for them arises.
	- **The theory of use and disuse:** This theory describes how organs which are used often, develop and strengthen over organs which aren’t used often. The organs that aren’t used often degenerate till they disappear.
	- **The theory of acquired characteristics by inheritance:**  This theory emphasises on the idea that all adaptive features developed are transferred to an organisms’ offspring through inheritance.

> **Natural Selection** is the differential survival and reproduction of individual organisms due to differences in their phenotype.

- **Charles Darwin** was a British biologist, in **1859** hypothesised a theory of organic evolution by **Natural Selection.** His theory is as follows:
	- **Overproduction:** All living organisms produce more offspring than can survive.
	- **Struggle for existence:** Due to overproduction, there is a constant struggle amongst offspring for survival.
	- **Offspring show variations:** No two offspring are the same.
	- **Adaptive Characteristics:** Some of the offspring are well adapted to survive more than others.
	- **Inheritance of Adaptive characteristics:** The offspring that are well adapted, pass on their adaptations to their own offspring while the offspring that aren’t well adapted die off.
	- **Development of new species:** An accumulation of well adapted offspring will in time lead to a **divergence** (spread) from the original stock with leads to the **formation of new species**. 

## Limitations of **Darwin’s** theory of evolution
- It doesn’t explain the source of individual variations
- Only inheritable traits can be passed not character behaviour

## Differences between Jean Lamarck’s Theory & Darwin’s Theory

- Modern theories on organic evolution are now based on the principles of **genetics**, **ecology**, **cytology**, **palaeontology**, **physiology**, **anatomy** and **embryology**.

The factors that contribute to modern evolution are:
- Natural selection
- Gene flow
- Genetic Drift
- Mutation



> **Mutation** is a change in genetic material resulting in a new stable characteristic which can be inherited by offspring.


> **Somatic Mutation** is an alternation of  genetic material after conception while **germline mutation** is an alternation in a body’s reproductive cell (egg or sperm) that becomes incorporated into the DNA of every cell in the body of the offspring. 

> **Gene flow** is the transfer of genetic material from one population to another.

> **Genetic Drift** is the random fluctuations in the numbers of gene variants in a population.

> **Speciation**  is the evolution of new species from existing species. it occurs through *mutation* or *isolation*
